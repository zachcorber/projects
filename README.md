These files are mainly coded in python (my language of choice) and are all personal small projects I have been working on for fun.
A new project coming soon are NHL stat projections based on season performance, end of year projections and overall team performances.
The NHL project is all based on the player and goalie CSV files in the repo which are updated every so often.
